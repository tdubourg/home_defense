You are defending your home in the garden against bees and frogs. This game has a desktop and VR version for Oculus Go.

# About

Game made over a weekend for the Global Game Jam by:

* Jean-Philippe Martin
* Sergey Semenov
* Th√©o D.
* Niko Korolog  (thanks for making the music!)

We spend most of our time with Unity 3D. We leveraged Unity's Tower Defense Template and multiple free assets (amusedART, BrokenVector, Laxer Assets). Music with Logic Pro X.

# Building for desktop

Open the project in Unity, select the "Level1" scene, pick the "PC, Mac & Linux Standalone" and build (we haven't tested it on Linux).

# Building for VR

Open the project in Unity, select the "Level1_VR" scene, pick the "Android" target, set "Texture Compression" to ASTC, and build.
